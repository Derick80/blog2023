## Context

VariantAlleles.com will use a distributed SQL database that is compatible with postgres to store data. The database is hosted on cockroachlabs cloud.


## Autolink literals

www.example.com, https://example.com, and contact@example.com.

## Footnote

A note[^1]

[^1]: Big note.

## Strikethrough

~one~ or ~~two~~ tildes.

## Table

| a | b  |  c |  d  |
| - | :- | -: | :-: |

## Tasklist

* [ ] to do
* [x] done
### CockroachDB

Connection string template:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD.HOST:PORT/DATABASE?sslmode=verify-full

## Decision

Using CockroachDB as the database for VariantAlleles.com has been useful for development as I test out different application frameworks. I can just place the conncection string in the .env file and the application will connect to the database.

I also used this database for the initial seeding of the app which involved large and complex datasets.

## Consequences
