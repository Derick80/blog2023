## Overview

I feel inspired. Its been a rough couple of weeks at VariantAlleles due to my self inflicted choice to migrate my Remix app hosted on Netlify to RemixV2. Many features are still down but I am making progress. I am also learning a lot about web development and bioinformatics.

So much so that I have been spending some time on BioStars. Now, I have to admit that I never really got into BioStars. It was the UI.
But I found a topic of interest on BioStars that I hadnt seen anywhere else. So I lingered and I started to think that this community might be pretty great.
