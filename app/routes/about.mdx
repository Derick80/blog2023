### About me

  I am a Senior Clinical Scientist for a large health care + tech company in
  Chicago IL.


Human genetics, data analysis, and the integration of big data into modern web
applications is what I stay up at night thinking about.

### Education and Experience

I completed my Ph.D in genetics at
[Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences](https://gsbs.tufts.edu/) in Boston, MA.
Human genetics
Inherited genetics
Cancer genetics
Genome builds
Variant science
Web technologies
Typescript
React
R
Python
-ORMs
CSS
HTML
PostgresQL

### Background


I was born in western New York state where I lived until I moved to Bolivar Missouri until I went off to college, quit college and moved to Boston in 2001.
I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Massachusetts Boston, then graduate school at Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and finally I worked as a post doctoral student at The Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Harvard Medical School.

After a couple of years I used my skill in interpreting genomic variants to join a small start up called Tempus labs. It's been five years and I have expanded the breadth of my understanding in genetics and have fostered emergent coding skills. I have used those skills to create new assays, support automation in production, and improve processes in between.

I'm really excited about the future in genetics and web development. I hope to find a really great position where I can use my fantastic scientific knowledge to inform data analysis, display and the development of modern web applications to view and use the data.
