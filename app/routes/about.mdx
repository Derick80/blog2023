## Background Information & Interests
### Personal Background
- I was born in western New York close to lake Ontario where I spent my childhood exploring the outdoors, biking, camping, riding 3-wheelers, and making up fantastical stories with my friends and sibling.
- I look back on my childhood with fondness and I'm grateful for the large family I was born into and the experiences I shared with them.
- I moved with my father to Bolivar, Missouri when I was in ninth grade. Missouri was a huge culture shock that would lead me to my big move to Boston after a short stint at Missouri University.
- In Boston I went back to college at the University of Massachusetts - Boston where I took my first biology course and earned an A. I was proud of myself and enrolled in several more biology courses as well as a number of pyschology courses.
- It was during my behavioral neuroscience course that I met my frist mentor.
- I worked in this laboratory for several years where I learned how to do research and how to think critically about the scientific process.

### Interests
- I am interested in the intersection of genetics, data science, and healthcare.
